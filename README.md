🧍 Hi there! I'm Daniele L.

🎓 I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Trento. 

🌱 I am still new to programming, but I hope I'll eventually help develop useful tools for everyone. 

💻 I am interested in mobile and web development and gaining a deeper understanding of topics such as machine learning and cryptography.

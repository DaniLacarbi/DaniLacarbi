Hi there! I'm Daniele L., and I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Trento. I am still new to programming but I hope I'll eventually help develop useful tools for everyone. I am interested in mobile and web development and gaining a deeper understanding of peculiar topics such as machine learning and cryptography.
